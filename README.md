### Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze social media engagement patterns and assess the impact of different content types on audience growth. By understanding which types of posts generate the most engagement and how these engagements correlate with follower increases, we can provide actionable insights for improving social media strategies.


### Introduction

This report presents an analysis of social media engagement patterns and the impact of different content types on audience growth. The objective was to uncover insights into which types of posts garner the most engagement and how these engagements correlate with an increase in followers.


### Methodology


1. Data Simulation: A simulated dataset representing typical social media metrics was created. This dataset spans six months and includes:

  - Post types (text, image, video)
  - Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
  - Audience growth metrics (new followers)


2. Data Analysis: The analysis focused on:

Calculating average engagement metrics for each post type.
Assessing the correlation between engagement metrics and new followers.
Identifying trends over time in engagement and follower growth.


3. Visualization and Reporting: Key findings were visualized using graphs and charts. A comprehensive report was generated to summarize the insights, including recommendations for optimizing social media content strategies.




### Findings

#### Average Engagement Metrics by Post Type:

- Video Posts: Showed the highest engagement across all metrics (likes, comments, shares) and the greatest increase in new followers.
- Image Posts: Had higher engagement than text posts but lower than video posts.
- Text Posts: Exhibited the least engagement and the lowest increase in new followers.

  #### Correlation between Engagement Metrics and New Followers:
    - A strong positive correlation was found between all engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) and the number of new followers.
    - Likes showed the strongest correlation with new follower growth.

  #### Trends Over Time:
    - Fluctuations in daily engagement metrics were observed, which is typical in social media dynamics.
    - Peaks in engagement often corresponded with increases in new followers, highlighting the impact of high-engagement posts on audience growth.



### Conclusion

To maximize social media presence and audience growth, stakeholders should focus on creating content that is more likely to engage users, particularly video content. While likes appear to have the greatest impact on follower growth, a holistic approach that also aims to increase comments and shares is recommended.
